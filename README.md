# Study Accountability

A tight Laravel API app for managing your commitments to study. In this project i got to try out some more advanced Laravel features and concepts, Here are some of them:

- Applying the **Action Pattern** to organize the app’s logic cleanly
- Implementing **advanced exception handling** for robust error management
- Writing **feature tests for every part of the app** using Pest
- Using **database caching** for high-load endpoints to optimize performance

## 📦 Features
- **Token-based authentication** powered by Laravel Sanctum
- **Full-text search** using Laravel Scout
- **Streak system** to track continuous commitment and reset when a session is missed
